GENERAL ASSEMBLER 'axx.py'

It was written in python, so the nickname is Paxx.

# Test environment

Arch linux terminal

# Main text

axx.py is a general assembler that generalizes assemblers. In theory, it can process almost any generic processor architecture. To process each processor architecture, a pattern file (processor description file) for it is required. You can define any instruction, but if you create a pattern file based on the assembly language of the target processor, you can process the assembly language of that processor, although the notation is slightly different. In short, it is just the grammar rules of the instructions and the generation of binaries based on them.

The execution platform is also independent of a specific processing system. It is also set to ignore chr(13) at the end of lines in DOS files. I think it will work on any processing system that runs python.

This version only has the core of the assembler, so it does not support practical features such as optimization, advanced macros, and debuggers that are provided by dedicated assemblers. For practical features, please use a preprocessor for macros. For now, please use a program that manages binary files and label (symbol) files as a linker/loader. Since this is not an IDE, please use an external debugger as a debugger. Optimization is not supported. I think it has basic functions, so please apply them. The current version is not practical enough.

Since the pattern file and source file are separated, it is possible to generate machine code for another processor from the source of a certain instruction set, if you do not mind the effort of coding. It is also possible to generate machine code for different processors from a common language. If you write multiple instruction codes in the binary_list of the pattern data, it will function as a macro, but it is not very smart. This allows you to write a simple compiler.

Pattern data has only control syntax: assignment, ternary operator, ; modifier, and alignment. It can be used to generate binaries, not just assembly language. Pattern files are not Turing complete. Because they are not Turing complete, they are not suitable for processors with complex architectures.

Since assembly language has a one-to-one correspondence with processor instruction code, axx was made possible.

axx reads assembler pattern data from the first argument, and assembles the source file of the second argument based on the pattern data. If the second argument is omitted, the source is input from the terminal (standard input).

The result is output as text to standard output, and if there is an argument specified with the `-o` option, a binary file is output to the current directory. The `-e` option outputs the labels specified with `.export` along with section/segment information to a file in TSV format.

In axx, the lines input from assembly language source files or standard input are named assembly lines.

## Explanation of pattern file

Pattern files are processor description files that are user-defined to correspond to individual processors. It is a kind of meta-language for machine code and assembly language.

If you find it difficult to define a pattern file, you can pass only the minimum number of operands to the expression evaluation and write it as a string literal.

Pattern data in a pattern file is arranged as follows.

```
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
:
:
```

Instruction is not optional. Error_patterns is optional. Binary_list is not optional.
Instruction, error_patterns, and binary_list should be separated by `::`.

for ex. (x86_64)

```
RET :: 0xc3
```

#### Comments

If you write `/*` in a pattern file, the part after `/*` on that line will become a comment. Currently, you cannot close it with `*/`. It is only valid after `/*` on that line.

#### Case Sensitivity, Variables

Uppercase letters in the pattern file's instruction are treated as character constants. Lowercase letters are treated as one-character variables. The value of the symbol at that position from the assembly line is assigned to the variable. If `! lowercase` is used, the value of the expression at that position is assigned, and if `!! lowercase` is used, the value of the factor at that position is assigned, and referenced from error_patterns and binary_list. All unassigned variables are initialized to 0. When referenced from error_patterns and binary_list, `!` is not necessary. All values ​​are referenced in the same way.

Lowercase variables are initialized to 0 for each line in the pattern file.

From the assembly line, uppercase and lowercase letters are accepted as the same, except for labels and section names.

The special variable is '$$', which represents the current location counter.

#### Escape Characters

The escape character `\` can be used within the instruction.

#### error_patterns

error_patterns uses variables and comparison operators to specify the conditions under which an error occurs.

Multiple error patterns can be specified, separated by ','. For example, as follows.

```
a>3;4,b>7;5
```
In this example, if a>3, error code 4 is returned, and if b>7, error code 5 is returned.

#### binary_list

binary_list specifies the codes to be output, separated by ','. For example, if you specify 0x03,d, 0x3 will be output followed by d.

Let's take 8048 as an example. If the pattern file contains

```
ADD A,R!n :: n>7;5 :: n|0x68
```

and you pass `add a,rn` to the assembly line, if n>7 it will return error code 5 (Register out of range), and `add a,r1` will generate a binary of 0x69.

If an element of binary_list is empty, it will be aligned. If it starts with `,` or if it is `0x12,,0x13`, the empty part will be padded up to the exact address.

If an element of binary_list is preceded by `;`, it will not be output if it is 0.

#### symbol

```
.setsym :: symbol :: n
```

Writing this defines symbol with the value n.

Symbols are letters, numbers, and strings of several symbols.

To define symbol2 with symbol1, write it as follows.

```
.setsym ::symbol1 ::1
.setsym ::symbol2 ::#symbol1
```

Here is an example of symbol definition z80. If you write the following in a pattern file:

```
.setsym ::B ::0
.setsym ::C ::1
.setsym ::D ::2
.setsym ::E ::3
.setsym ::H ::4
.setsym ::L ::5
.setsym ::A ::7
.setsym ::BC ::0x00
.setsym ::DE ::0x10
.setsym ::HL ::0x20
.setsym ::SP ::0x30
```

The symbols B, C, D, E, H, L, A, BC, DE, HL, and SP will be defined as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0x00, 0x10, 0x20, and 0x30, respectively. Symbols are not case sensitive.

If there are multiple definitions of the same symbol in a pattern file, the new one will replace the old one. That is,

```
.setsym ::B::0
.setsym ::C::1
ADD A,s

.setsym ::NZ::0
.setsym ::Z::1
.setsym ::NC::2
.setsym ::C ::3
RET s
```
In this case, the C in ADD A,C is 1, and the C in RET C is 3.

・Example of a symbol that contains a mixture of symbols, numbers, and letters

```
.setsym ::$s5:: 21
```

To clear a symbol, use `.clearsym`.

```
.clearsym::ax
```

The above example undefines the symbol `ax`.

To clear everything, do not specify any arguments.

```
.clearsym
```

You can determine the character set to use for symbols from within the pattern file.

```
.symbolc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters in `<characters>`.

The default is letters + numbers + `'_%$-~&|'`.

#### Pattern order

Pattern files are evaluated from top to bottom, so the pattern placed first takes precedence. Special patterns should be placed first, and general patterns should be placed last. Like below.

```
LD A,(HL)
LD A,e
```

#### Double brackets

Optional items in the instruction can be enclosed in double brackets. This shows the `inc (ix)` instruction for z80.

```
INC (IX[[+!d]]) :: 0xdd,0x34,d
```

In this case, the initial value of the lowercase variable is 0, so `inc (ix+0x12)` is output as `0xdd,0x34,0x12` if not omitted, and `inc (ix)` is output as `0xdd,0x34,0x00` if omitted.

#### Specifying the padding bytecode

If you add

```
.padding::0x12
```

to the pattern file, the padding bytecode will be 0x12. The default is 0x00.

#### Specifying the number of bits for processors whose words are not in 8-bit units

If you specify

```
.bits::12
```

in the pattern file, you can handle 12-bit processors. The default is 8 bits.

Use this directive to assemble processors that are less than 8 bits, such as bit slice processors or processors whose machine language words are not in byte units. Since axx outputs in 8-bit units, the lower 4 bits are output to the binary file in 8-bit increments for a 4-bit processor, and (lower 8 bits, upper 3 bits) or (upper 3 bits, lower 8 bits) for an 11-bit processor, depending on the specified byte order. Any extra bits within 8 bits are masked with 0.

If you specify the .bits directive, the value indicated by the address will be in words. For example, the 64-bit processor x86_64 can process in bytes, so there is no need to specify the .bits directive.

Specify the byte order as follows:

```
.bits::big::12
```

big arranges bytes in big endian. little arranges them in little endian.
The default is little, and it will be used even if not specified.

#### include

This allows you to include a file.

```
.include "file.axx"
```

### VLIW processor

#### .vliw directive

```
.vliw::128::41::5::00
```

This will allow you to handle an EPIC processor with a bundle bit count of 128, instruction bit count of 41, template bit count of 5, and NOP code of 0x00 (Itanium example).

For example, on Itanium, there are three 41-bit instructions, a set of instructions with a length of 41*3=123 (bits) + 5 template bits at the beginning. If it is not EPIC, specify 0 for the template bits.

##### For EPIC

For EPIC processors, the pattern file is written as follows.

```
/* VLIW
.setsym::R1::1
.setsym::R2::2
.setsym::R3::3
.setsym::R4::4
.vliw::128::41::5::00
EPIC::1,2::0x8
EPIC::1::0x01
AD a,b,c:: ::0x01,0,0,a,b,c::1
LOD d,[!e]:: :: 0x00,0x01,0,d,e,e>>8::2
```

Written like this, `EPIC::1,2::0x8` represents the set of EPIC instructions, and the code with template 0x8 for the bundle of instructions with indexes 1 and 2.
The next, `AD a,b,c:: ::0x01,0,0,a,b,c::1` means that the ADD instruction r1,r2,r3 outputs 0x01,0,0,a,b,c without error checking, and the index code is 1, and `LOD d,[!e]:: :: 0x00,0x01,0,d,e,e>>8::2` means that the LOAD instruction r4 stores the contents of [!e], outputs 0,1,0,0xd,e (lower 8 bits), e (upper 8 bits) without error checking, and the index code is 2. This sample is for testing purposes and differs from the actual bytecode.

The parameter specified in .viw must match the number of bytes represented by the pattern, which is (number of bits in the bundle - number of bits in the template divided by 8 (bits)) + (1 if there is a remainder, 0 if not).

##### Non-EPIC VLIW

For non-EPIC processors, the pattern file is written as follows.

```
/* VLIW
.setsym::R1::1
.setsym::R2::2
.setsym::R3::3
.setsym::R4::4

.vliw::128::32::0::0x00
AD a,b,c:: ::0x01,a,b,c::1
LOD d,[!e]:: :: 0x02,d,e,e>>8::2
JMP !a :: :: 0x03,a,a>>8,0::3
```

##### Concatenating instructions

To put multiple VLIW instructions into one bundle, connect them with `!!` as shown below.

```
ad r1,r2,r3 !! lod r4,[0x1234]
```

In VLIW, the error pattern must be explicitly specified as `:: ::`.

### Assembly file explanation

#### label

Labels can be defined from the assembly line in the following way.

```
label1:
label2: .equ 0x10
label3: nop
```

A label is a string of letters, numbers, and some symbols that starts with a non-numeric `.`, an alphabet, or some symbols.

To define a label with a label, do the following:

```
label4: .equ label1
```

You can determine the character set to use for labels from within the pattern file.

```
.labelc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters in `<characters>`.

The default is letters + numbers + underscore + period.

If you add `:` after the label reference, it will check for undefined label errors. In assembly languages ​​that use `:`, add a space after the label reference.

#### ORG

ORG is specified from the assembly line as

```
.org 0x800
or
.org 0x800,p
```

.org changes the value of the location counter. If `,p` is added, if the previous location counter value is smaller than the value specified by .org, it will be padded to the value specified by .org.

#### Alignment

If you enter .align 16 from an assembly line,

```
.align 16
```

it will align to 16 (pad with the bytecode specified by .padding up to an address that is a multiple of 16). If you omit the argument, it will align to the value specified by the previous .align or the default value.

#### Floating point, number notation

For example, suppose you have a processor that includes floating point operands, and `MOVF fa,3.14` loads the float 3.14 into the fa register, with the opcode being 01. In this case, the pattern data is

```
MOVF FA,!d ::0x01,d>>24,d>>16,d>>8,d
```

If you pass `movf fa,flt(3.14)` to the assemble line, the binary output will be 0x01,0xc3,0xf5,0x48,0x40. If flt is dbl, it is a double precision floating point, and if it is qad, it is a quadruple precision floating point.

In the current specification, expressions are allowed for x in flt(x) and dbl(x), but only constants are allowed for x in qad(x), and nan, inf, and -inf are only handled within flt(x), dbl(x), and qad(x).

Please prefix binary numbers with '0b'.

Please prefix hexadecimal numbers with '0x'.

#### string

`.ascii` outputs the bytecode of a string, and `.asciiz` outputs the bytecode of a string with 0x00 at the end.

```
.ascii "sample1"
.asciiz "sample2"
```

#### export

The following command exports a label along with section/segment information. Only the label specified by the .export command is exported.

```
.export label
```

#### section

The following command allows you to specify a section/segment.

```
section .text
or
segment .text
```

Currently, section and segment have the same meaning.

#### section sort

For example,

```
section .text
ld a,9
section .data
.asciiz "test1"
section .text
ld b,9
section .data
db 0x12
```

If you do this, the text will be arranged exactly as it is, so use section sort to sort it.

https://qiita.com/fygar256/items/fd590cab2078a4e8b866

```
section .text
ld a,9
ld b,9
section .data
.asciiz "test1"
db 0x12
```
#### include

You can include a file like this.

```
.include "file.s"
```

#### comments

Assembly line comments are `;`.

## Expressions, operators

Since the assembly line expressions and pattern data expressions call the same functions, they work almost the same. Variables in lowercase cannot be referenced from the assembly line.

#### Operator precedence

Operators and precedence are based on Python and are as follows.

```
(expression)         An expression enclosed in parentheses
#                    An operator that returns the value of a symbol
flt(x),dbl(x)        Operators that convert x to float and double bytecodes, respectively
qad(x)               Operators that convert x to a 128-bit floating point number. However, in this case, x can only be a constant.
-,~                  Negative, bitwise NOT
@                    Unary operator that returns the bit position from the right of the most significant bit of the value that follows
:=                   Assignment operator
**                   Power
*,/,//               Multiplication, division, integer division
+,-                  Addition, subtraction
<<,>>                Left shift, right shift
&                    Bitwise AND
|                    Bitwise OR
^                    Bitwise XOR
'                    Sign extension
<=,<,>,>=,!=,==      Comparison operators
not(x)               Logical NOT
&&                   Logical AND
||                   Logical OR
x?a:b                Ternary operator
```

There is an assignment operator `:=`. If you enter `d:=24`, 24 will be assigned to the variable d. The value of the assignment operator is the assigned value.

The prefix operator `#` takes the value of the symbol that follows.

The prefix operator `@` returns the bit position from the right of the most significant bit of the value that follows. We'll call this the Hebimarumatta operator.

The binary operator `'`, for example `a'24`, will make the 24th bit of a the sign bit and perform sign extension (Sign EXtend). We'll call this the SEX operator.

The binary operator `**` is exponentiation.

The ternary operator `?:`, for example `x?a:b`, will return a if x is true and b if it is false.

## Example of binary output

```
.setsym:: BC:: 0x00
.setsym:: DE:: 0x10
.setsym:: HL:: 0x20
LD s,!d:: (s&0xf!=0)||(s>>4)>3;9 :: s|0x01,d&0xff,d>>8
```

Then, `ld bc,0x1234, ld de,0x1234, ld hl,0x1234` output `0x01,0x34,0x12, 0x11,0x34,0x12, 0x21,0x34,0x12`, respectively.

#### 8086

The same mnemonic for registers of different byte length is handled as follows.

```8086.axx
.setsym::SI::0
.setsym::BX::0

/*********************************************************************/
/* If AX or AL appears at this point, neither will match the pattern */

/* Define AL. At this point, AL matches the pattern
.setsym::AL::0xb0
MOV s,!a :: 0xb0,a
.clearsym::AL　/* Clear symbol AL

/* Define AX. At this point, AX matches the pattern.
.setsym::AX::0xb8
MOV s,!a::0xb8,a,a>>8
.clearsym::AX　/* Clear symbol AX
/********************************************************************/
MOV BYTE [e + f + !c],!d::0xc6,c>=0x100?0x80:0x40,c,;c>>8,d

MOV BYTE [!a],!b :: 0xc6,0x6,a,a>>8,b
MOV WORD [e + f + !a],!b::0xc7,a>=0x100?0x80:0x40,a,;a>>8,b,b>>8
MOV WORD [e + f],!a :: 0xc7,0,a,a>>8
MOV WORD [!a],!b::0xc7,0x06,a,a>>8,b,b>>8
```

```8086.s
mov byte [bx+si],0x12
mov byte [0x3412],0x56
mov byte [bx+si+0x12],0x34
mov byte [bx+si+0x3412],0x56

mov word [bx+si+0x12],0x5634
mov word [bx+si+0x3412],0x7856
mov ax,0x3412
```

### Testing some instructions on some processors

Because this is a test, the binary is different from the actual code.

```test.axx
/* test
.setsym ::a:: 7
.setsym ::b:: 1
.setsym ::%% ::7
.setsym ::||:: 8

LEAQ r,[s,t,!d,!e] :: 0x48,0x8d,0x04,((@d)-1)<<6|t<<3|s,e
LEAQ r, [ s + t * !!h + !!i ] :: 0x48,0x8d,0x04,((@h)-1)<<6|t<<3|s,i

/* ookakko test
LD (IX[[+!d]]),(IX[[+!e]]):: 0xfd,0x04,d,e
NOP :: 0x01
```

For x86_64 expressions such as `LEAQ r,[s+t*h+i]`, please write `LEAQ r,[s+t*!!h+!!i]`. If you write `!h` instead of `!!h`, when pattern matching, the assembly line expression evaluation function will interpret the part after 2 in `leaq rax,[rbx+rcx*2+0x40]` as `!h`, and will interpret the part after that as an expression, 2+0x40, as `!h`, and 2+0x40 will be substituted for h, resulting in a syntax analysis error for the remaining `+!!i`. `!!h` is a factor, and `!h` is an expression. This is because escape characters in expressions cannot be processed.

```test.s 
leaq rax , [ rbx , rcx , 2 , 0x40]
leaq rax , [ rbx + rcx * 2 + 0x40]
addi $v0,$a0,5
st1 {v0.4s},[x0]
add r1, r2, r3 lsl #20
rep movsb
movsb
```

Execution example 

``` $ axx.py test.axx test.s

## errors

・If the label overlaps with a symbol in the pattern file, a "is a pattern file symbol error" will occur.

・If the same label is defined more than once, a "label already defined" error will occur.

・If syntax analysis is not possible, a "syntax error" will occur.

・If an undefined label is referenced, a "Label undefined" error will occur.

・If the syntax is incorrect, an "Illegal syntax in assembler line" or "pattern line" will occur.

・If no template set for instruction of EPIC, "No template set." error will occur.

・If any of the conditions in error_patterns are met, an error will occur. In that case, the following messages will appear for error codes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 (Value out of range, Invalid syntax, Address out of range, Register out of range, Port number out of range). If there are not enough types of errors, add an error message to the source.

## Comments

-Sorry for the original notation.

-I know it's a ridiculous request, but quantum computers and LISP machines are not supported.

The assembly language of quantum computers is called quantum assembly, and is not assembly language.

LISP machine programs are not assembly language.

-From homemade processors to supercomputers, please feel free to use them.

-Please evaluate, extend, and modify axx. The structure is difficult to understand, but since it is written in Python, it is easy to extend. Please feel free to extend it.

-It is difficult to put escape characters in expressions.

-For now, only constants can be used for quadruple precision floating point numbers. This is the specification of python3. It would be nice if quadruple precision floating point numbers could be handled in python4.

-nan, inf, and -inf processing can only be used in flt(x), dbl(x), and qad(x). Nan, inf, and -inf are first loaded into registers or memory, or constants are taken as operands, and then the processor performs the calculations, so this may be sufficient.

- Use the preprocessor for the macro function. It would be nice if there were more advanced macros.

- For now, when the linker loader specifies option `-i`, it imports labels from the TSV file, and when the option `-e` is specified, the label specified in .export is exported to the file in TSV along with the section/segment to which the label belongs, so this is used.

- I've made it possible to refer to the labels of an assembler file from a pattern file. Using this allows you to write simple compiled languages, but the structure becomes very complicated, so it's best to avoid it.

- It's slow because it repeats pattern matching, but you can expect to see speed improvements by using a Python compiler.

- Generator AI, this article is complicated, but please analyze it properly. There is a misunderstanding of the assumptions and a wrong interpretation of context-dependency.

## Items not yet implemented

- Make it compatible with the linker.

・I want to put it to practical use. I only have Linux, so I'll use Linux. The special solution for Linux is to support ELF relocatable object files and make them linkable with ld.

・The order of evaluation of pattern files is difficult.

・Make it possible to take an expression for x in qad(x).

・Now that the core is complete, I think it would be a great system if I prepared a pattern file for axx and added a linker, high-performance macros, optimization functions, and an IDE wrapper, but it would be difficult for an individual to complete such a large project, so please make one. I would be happy if it were put to practical use.

#### Axx's next generation pattern file (processor description file) Feature not available now

・If the pattern file were made into a more descriptive metalanguage, it would be more readable, would not depend on the order of evaluation, would be easier to write control syntax, and would make it easier to debug the processor description file. However, pattern data can be written more intuitively. If you generalize the meta-language further, use a descriptive meta-language in the pattern file, and give string literals, string operations, and numerical operations to binary_list, as well as control syntax, you can generate an intermediate language or make a converter between assembly languages. At that time, rename binary_list to object_list and pattern file to processor_specification_file. I wonder if eval can be used. The meta-language becomes a multi-line descriptive language from pattern data. It is feasible. Someone is apparently working on making one based on axx. You can use mine. The expression requires an escape character, so the pattern matching algorithm is different. Even in the pattern file, if you give a command (string) to a character variable (currently lowercase alphabet, but if you expand it to a symbol as it is normally called) as a='MOV b,c' and write it in binary_list, you can write macros smartly. b=rep(a,10) outputs a 10 times, or align(n), etc. If loop structures are allowed, debugging becomes extremely complicated if an infinite loop occurs when processing inside axx.py, but if evaluation is only performed on the pattern file, debugging becomes easier and loop structures and branch structures are also allowed. If it is Turing complete, it can handle completely arbitrary processor architectures. Self-reference check is required. expand(a) is used for expansion. For example, if a='b ; c' b='MOV AX,d' c='JMPC e', it becomes 'MOV AX,d ; JMPC e'. expression(a) is used for expression evaluation, and label: is used for label definition. If labels are kept separate in the processor description file and the assembly file, it is not necessary to worry if the same label appears in both. EPIC-like meta-processing is solved by enumerating variables. Drastic rewriting is required to make it a descriptive metalanguage. If the assembler's processor characteristic description file becomes complicated, it becomes difficult to achieve file compatibility with General Disassembler.
